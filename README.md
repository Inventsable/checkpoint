# CRITICAL

- Something's going wrong with Groups, their contents aren't being processed

# TODO

- Write scripting in such a way that panel can process chunks rather than entire artwork file, would be needed on largest of files
- Create basic demo site with Lottie outlines of Pear and Mango, credit original artist
- Needs input-scroll autoselect
- Potential link to Swatches or themes per Antonio's feedback. If users want to use it on certain artwork with same color schemes often then it'd make sense for them to be able to link multiple themes
- Could be fetching a version number via stores/core and display when the panel is outdated. Could even include a Changelog tab similar to Help pages in the popup to display any new additions so users can see what's new, which would be pretty cool
- Noticing that the CSS transitions fire on panel mount for color-picker and checkbox... It'd be better if the transitions were disabled until a second or two after mount so they appear in their intended state rather than having default transitioning to intended the first 200ms or so of the panel mount.
